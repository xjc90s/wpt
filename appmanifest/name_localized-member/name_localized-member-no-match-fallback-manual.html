<h1>Testing non-localized fallback for <code>name_localized</code></h1>
<p>
    Set your browser locale to one that is not in the manifest (e.g.,
    <code>de</code>, <code>zh</code>, or <code>ko</code>). Install this page as
    a web application. To pass, the browser must fall back to the non-localized
    <code>name</code> field and the installed app name must be "fallback-name".
